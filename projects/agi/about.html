                        <p>Advanced Group for Information Technology (AGI) was founded in 2009 as Arab Group for Assessment (AGA) to serve as Educational Assessment and Software Partner to Al-Ola Modern Systems Hardware Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>After sometime, AGI founders decided to widen and deepen AGI’s scope of work throughout the implementation of information technology in different fields and chose Advanced Group of Information Technology (AGI) as a new brand to reflect professionalism of the teamwork and integration of IT services and technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through partnerships and alliances, AGI started a new phase of business to become a leading Middle East company in the fields of software and educational services.
